# Calculator-Java
Example of a simple calculator in Java

1. **Data Storage:**
    - Creating variables to store the user's input.

2. **User Input:**
    - Implementation of a way for the user to input numbers and operations.

4. **Parsing and Validation:**
    - Parsing the user input to extract numbers and operations. Validating the input to ensure it's a valid number and a valid operation.

5. **Perform Calculations:**
    - Based on the user's input, program performs the corresponding mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

6. **Display Result:**
    - Showing the result of the calculation to the user.

7. **Handling Errors:**
    - Implementing error handling for cases such as division by zero or invalid input. Display appropriate error messages to the user.

9. **Optional Features:**
    - Adding additional features, such as support for decimals, or handling more complex operations (square root, exponentiation, etc.).

10. **Testing:**
    - Testing calculator with various input scenarios to ensure it works correctly and handles errors gracefully., consider packaging it into a standalone executable or a JAR file for ease of use.
